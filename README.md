### Hi there 👋 :)

<img align="right" width="50%" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=cybertramp&count_private=true&show_icons=truehow_icons=true&hide_border=true" />

I work as a software engineer in the FADU Test framework development part. I mainly develop test framework for SSD validation and verification, along with related tools.

I enjoy contributing to and using open source projects with Python, Go, and Vue.

If anyone wants to collaborate on a project with me, feel free to reach out anytime.
